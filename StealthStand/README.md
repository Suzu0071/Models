________

 
There are 2 types: if you want to use the fake printed carriage, or if you have a spare MGN12H lying around.

The feet for the FakeCarriage are the same, print 2x of them. Just make sure the heatset hole is oriented correctly (the flat part should be on top).

The feet for the rail version are different, orient them so that the flat part of the heatset hole is facing upward.

For the FakeCarriage, you will need:
+ 1x 2020 extrusion of your liking. I used a v-slot from the x axis of my ender, but normal Misumi ones should work too.
+ 6x M3 heatsets. 4 for the printed carriage, and 2 for the feet.
+ 2x ~12mm M3 screw for the feet. Mine stayed on tight without the screws, so this could be optional.

I'll make an MGN9 version when I get around to it.
